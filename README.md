# To-Do-List-Application
To-Do List Application in C++ Project Overview This project is a simple yet powerful To-Do List application built using C++. It offers a practical solution for managing daily tasks by allowing users to add, remove, and view to-do items. The to-do items are saved to a text file, ensuring persistent storage between sessions.
This project goes beyond simple output, providing hands-on experience with file handling and basic data management, both of which are essential skills for any C++ developer. By creating this tool, you'll take a step into real-world programming by managing and storing data persistently, making this project not only a learning experience but also a functional utility for everyday use.
